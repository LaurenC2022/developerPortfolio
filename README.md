L. Collins: Frontend software developer

This repository is my personal protfolio website.

To Do:

- fix the scroll to stop at About Me, issue: the button takes user past the about me heading. I would like the heading to appear at the top of the page for about me after the button is pressed

- spacing in navigation bar at the top

- comment my code
