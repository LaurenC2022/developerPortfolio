        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p>
          I am passionate about computer programming. This is why I am currently
          pursuing a bachelor's of science degree in applied computer science
          from a college of engineering and applied science. I have built
          several, personal, frontend web application projects seen on my GitHub
          account. I have also built a python project for modeling the
          Rivest-Shamir-Adleman Algorithm. You can see this project in my
          portfolio above.

          <br /><br />

          In my work as a middle school math teacher, I have experience
          communicating and working efficiently in a team of professionals. I
          would like to use my teaching background to speak at conferences or
          universities around the globe.
          I am focusing my work on C sharp, Azure hosting and Dot Net for
          application development. I would like for a large part of my work to
          involve Microsoft's frameworks. Over the next five years, I would like
          to become an independent contributor. By the middle of my career and
          in 10 to 15 years, I will know the nitty gritty of software
          development methodologies and data driven development as a project
          manager. Lastly, my long term goals include being highly trained in
          orchestrating functional, secure, and accessible computer applications
          with architecture for scalability. At the end of my career, I will be
          a distinguished software architect. Right now, I am interested in
          knowing as much as I can about computer application engineering. I am actively 
          working toward accomplishing my professional goals in my daily life. 
          
          <br><br>
          
          Currently, I am considering open source projects to contribute to. 
          I am challenging myself through leading workshops on topics which I am learning. 
          I am learning, through teaching.   
          I am planning to teach workshops on the topic of software development
           methodologies for Virtual Coffee, my local 
          Code Bar community and for https://cfe.dev  in September of this year. Next I would like to teach 
          workshops on the topic of algorithms and data structures in c sharp using test driven development, 
          and agile development in early 2025. 
          I am preparing myself for my future goals every day. 
          <br /><br />
          My goal while at university is to gain a good foundation in computer
          science, which will lead to a long career and life long learning in
          the field of computer application development. I can be a valuable
          team member in a variety of projects. I am skilled in problem solving
          and utilizing online communities to find the most suitable coding
          solutions. I am open to work and would ideally like to join a team of
          seasoned engineers. I can contribute my programming, excellent
          communication and problem solving skills. I seek to build long lasting
          professional relationships.
