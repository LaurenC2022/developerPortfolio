      <h2>About Me</h2>

      <p>
        I like frontend software development, because it combines art, math and consideration for people.
      </p>
      <p>
        I enjoy frontend development, because I have the opportunity to work closely with the design team on their
        ideas.
        Math adds a level of predictability and reason. I enjoy solving problems that can be solved through logic.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lastly, detailed consideration for the user is crucial throughout frontend development.
        In my undergraduate studies and work as a middle school math teacher, I learned there is need for accessibility
        in our
        diverse communities.
        My work allowed me the opportunity to have deeply seeded empathy for people.
        My professors and students taught me many ways to consider their needs in the work I do.
        In the future, I would like to know more on coding for accessibility so my work can best serve the diverse needs
        of our communities.
      </p>
      <p>
        For these reason - art, math and consideration of others - I choose to work in frontend development.
      </p>

      <p>
        My career goals includes: continueing my education in frontend development and earning a masters in the field of
        software engineering.
        To continue learning frontend development and to prepare for a masters degree, I am completing website
        development
        and computer science coursework.
        I am using materials by Free Code Camp, MDN Web Docs, Web Coding for Dummies and similar learning materials.
        In the future, I would like to use my experiences and my degrees to lead a team of software
        engineers.
        I want to build functional, secure, and accessible software with architecture for scalability.
