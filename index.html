      <h2>About Me</h2>

      <p>
        I like frontend software development, because it's an artful, complex and empathetic field.
        Frontend developers have the opportunity to work closely with the design team on their
        ideas. Creativity and creative people are fun.
        Working on technical problems is another benefit to working as a frontend developer. I enjoy working on highly
        technical
        problems
        that can be solved
        through logic.

        Lastly, detailed consideration for the user is crucial throughout frontend development.
        In my undergraduate studies and work as a middle school math teacher, I learned there is need for accessibility
        in our
        diverse communities.
        For these reasons - art, math and consideration of users - I choose to work in frontend development.
      </p>

      <br>

      <p>
        My career goals include: gaining experience in frontend website development, and earning a masters
        in
        software engineering.
        To prepare for work as a developer, I am completing website
        development coursework.
        I am using materials by Free Code Camp, MDN Web Docs, the book <em>Web Coding and Development for Dummies</em>
        and
        similar learning materials to learn frontend website development.
        I plan to be employed as a frontend developer by the end of 2023, and move on to my next goal: gaining a good
        foundation in computer science.

        <br><br>

        Over the next 3 to 5 years, I will be earning certifications from an accredited and highly ranked computer
        science
        college in
        undergraduate software engineering studies, remotely.
        Then I would like to start applying to masters degree programs in computer science or
        software
        engineering.
        <br><br>
        Professionally, I want to be highly trained in building functional, secure, and accessible software with
        architecture for scalability.
        Personally, my goal is to leverage my experiences, knowledge and degrees to travel to new places and
        countries
        with my family.
